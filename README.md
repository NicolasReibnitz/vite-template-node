# vite-template-node

Very basic Node.js template.

## Start new project

First, clone the template repo as your new project.

Here we are using the name `my-project` as an example:

```bash
npx degit NicolasReibnitz/vite-template-node my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

Now, search and replace the word `template` with whatever command you would like to use as the library name.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
```
